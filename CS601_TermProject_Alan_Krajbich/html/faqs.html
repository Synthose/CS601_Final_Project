            <h3 class="question">What is a Rogue-like / Rogue-Lite? </h3>
            <p id="q1p1">Rogue was a classic game from the early 80s that focused on small, single shot adventures. The player controlled character started with a basic set of equipment, and obtained weapons, potions, scrolls, and armor through each level. What set Rogue apart from other games, however, was that every item was randomly generated and placed in the world, and each level of the dungeon was also procedurally generated. Enemy placement, shop stock, and effects were all built in real time as you played, and every playthrough was different. When you died in the game, all progress was lost, and each new game started from scratch. It was revolutionary in that it was the first game to be functionally infinite.</p>

            <p id="q1p2">Rogue-likes and Rogue-lites are genres of games that take heavy inspiration from Rogue. Generally, Rogue-like and Rogue-lite games revolve around randomly generated runs through procedurally generated levels. Progress is usually not carried over, and each run starts you fresh. Player builds are different each run because the items, weapons, and armor you collect along the way is always different. The video below explains the rise of the Rogue-like well, as well as what makes a rogue-like so appealing.</p>

            <p id="q3p1">Because this is an unstarted prject, and I haven't had enough time to really mature it yet! Have some Lorem Ipsum instead!</p>
