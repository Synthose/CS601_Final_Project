    <p>Hi Monty. I didn't want to spring this on you like last time, so I put it in this format so that you can read it, or not, at your leisure. This page is unarchived and non-indexed.
        Only you can access it. </p>
        <p>
        The last 2 weeks have been really difficult. I'm not sleeping very well, not out of grief, anger, or depression, but just out of confusion and frustration. I am making this page as
        a way to have a serious, good faith post-mortem into what happened between us. If this is something you are really not interested in, then thats fine. Getting this all out on "paper"
        will do me good one way or another.</p>
        <p>I'm going to start from a few simple assumptions. I think they are fair assumptions to make, and I hope I'm not taking anything in error</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Based on both of our letters/rants at the end, its clear that we both cared and loved for the other person deeply until the end.</li>
            <li>We both had feelings of distrust and resentment built up towards the other person which we felt were not being addressed.</li>
            <li>We both saw this coming for a while, but neither wanted to pull the trigger on the end. We both wanted it to be better.</li>
            <li>(This may be the contentious one)Seattle was the primary turning point in the relationship, and things began to decline after we returned.</li>
        </ul>

        <p> My hope here is to try and work out why and how we went from feelings of mutual joy and real trust to where we ended up. I'm not looking to blame anyone. I don't think
            either of us wanted this. I'm not trying to repair it either; I just want to trace thing to their source, and make sure that somethign like this doesn't happen in the future.
        </p>
        <p>I've been wracking my brain, going over the events of Seattle, trying to think about if and where the seed of doubt was planted. You had told me that you were insecure and easily
            easily upset by the prospect of my cheating on you, and that it was something you'd been dealing with for a while. We then, shortly after, had a long conversation where we went in depth
            about all the times we had been unfaithful to our previous partners. This, to me, feels like a pretty obvious candidate. We talked about your insecurity, then we went and reinforced that
            fear. 
        </p>
        <p> For that reason, I have my first question for you: Did you believe that was going to, or had cheated on you at any point during our time together? Beas honest with yourself
            as you can.
        </p>
        <p>For my part, I do think that conversation is where I first got an idea that you might use other people or sex as a way to punish or hurt me. I trusted you logically, but I think
            I hadn't really thought about you in that way before. One thing I've learned over hard nights is that I stopped knowing how to think of your new partners, and part of got really scared.
        </p>
        <p> That conversation was an important one to have, but I don't think we really debriefed and reinforced and aftercared eachother afterwards. I know that I didn't make it clear how 
            far in the past the person was who did that. Regardless of how you answered the question above, I feel I should tell you that I did not, and never would have cheated. I was so dedicated
            at that point.

        <p>The second half of July, and most of August had a lot of very difficult moments for us. I think we had entered into a viscious cycle of feeling hurt, lashing out subconsciously,
            then trying to make ammends in some way.
