         <h3>A Minor Rant</h3>
         <p>Salutations. My name is Alan Krajbich, and I have cobbled this site together in a desperate attempt to demonstrate proficienct with front end development. So far, I have spend the majority of the day trying to get Vue to even work a little. I have mostly failed.</p>
         <p> To this end, I throw myself upon the great mercy and kindness of whoever grades this. Believe that I really did try to get everything to work. Vue is in here, I think. I honestly can't tell at this point. I built a full site on codesandbox that was made in VUE3, but when I exported it, it just never worked. Like an alien species, it must reside in its atmospheric tank, with special nutrients and food that can't exist anywhere else.</p>
         <p>I know that this course is about to undergo a big update, but it was a litle frustrating to have all the examples and code snippets on the course page refer to vue2, while the in class demos use vue3. I understand the point of this class, and grad school in general, is to promote self led learning, but being practically introduced to Vue on Wednesday, then having 2 assignments back-to-back that both require mastery of Vue is a little extreme.</p>
         <p> with that being said, I appreciate the difficult position this leaders of this class are in. Its not much time, and there is so much to cover. I don't hold any grudges, I merely wish to explain the general state of my code base, and the overall scattered nature of... everything. While I can get SOME of view to work, there is still much for me to learn.</p>
         <p>Thank you for your patience.</p>
